    "## Understanding Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) & Use of Vector Store\n",
    "*by Ong Chin Ann, edited by Bernice Koh*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives\n",
    "- To understand the concept of Retrival Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "- To understand the usage of text-embedding model for vectorization\n",
    "- To familarized with LangChain RAG-related components (Document Loader, Text Splitter, retrievers etc...)\n",
    "- To develop a custom chatbot with RAG approach\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find understanding RAG difficult, maybe you can look through the following resource after you have completed the exercise/walkthrough. <br/>\n",
    "Link: https://www.datacamp.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### RAG Processes\n",
    "* Step 1: Loading and Chunking Data\n",
    "* Step 2: Construct Vector Store / Database\n",
    "* Step 3: Perform Similarity Search based on user Query\n",
    "* Step 4: Generate response from LLM based on document retrieved from the Vector Database and user query\n",
