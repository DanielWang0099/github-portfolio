# 🐕 Dog Breed Identification with Neural Networks

## Project Overview
This project tackles the challenge of identifying dog breeds using **deep learning** techniques. With 120 unique breeds to classify and limited training data per class, this is a fine-grained image classification problem that requires robust neural networks to distinguish between similar breeds.

The project uses:
- **TensorFlow**: For building, training, and evaluating the deep neural networks.
- **Google Colab**: For GPU-powered training, enabling faster model experimentation.
- **ImageNet Canine Subset**: A labeled dataset with images of 120 dog breeds.

## Problem Statement
The primary question this project aims to answer is:
> "What breed of dog is in this image?"
>

## Approach

### Dataset
- The dataset is a canine subset of **ImageNet**, containing:
  - 120 unique dog breeds.
  - A limited number of training images per class.

### Tools & Libraries
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training neural networks.
- **Google Colab**: For running the experiments with GPU acceleration.
- **Pandas/NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training metrics and predictions.

### Neural Network Architecture
1. **Transfer Learning**: A pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet50, InceptionV3, or EfficientNet) is fine-tuned for dog breed classification.
   - **Why Transfer Learning?**
     - Leverages features learned from large datasets (like ImageNet).
     - Speeds up training and improves accuracy with limited data.
2. **Custom Fully Connected Layers**:
   - Add a dense output layer with 120 neurons for classification (one per breed).
   - Softmax activation for probability distribution over the breeds.

## Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Resize images to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224).
   - Normalize pixel values to [0, 1].
   - Perform data augmentation (e.g., random flips, rotations, and zooms).

2. **Model Design**:
   - Use a pre-trained convolutional base (e.g., ResNet50).
   - Add custom classification layers for fine-tuning.

3. **Training**:
   - Use **categorical cross-entropy** as the loss function.
   - Optimize with **Adam** for adaptive learning rates.
   - Train with a **validation split** to monitor generalization.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate on a test set.
   - Metrics: **Accuracy** and **Confusion Matrix** to analyze performance per breed.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Export the trained model for inference.
   - Create a script or Colab notebook to classify new dog images.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: Achieved ~85% accuracy on the validation set with a fine-tuned ResNet50 model.
- **Challenges**:
  - Similarity between certain breeds led to misclassifications.
  - Limited training data required careful augmentation and regularization.
